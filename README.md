# Codecademy - Front-End Engineer Path - Challenge Project: Build a Website Design System

## Overview
This is my solution to the Challenge Project: Build a Website Design System that can be found on the [Front-End Engineer path from Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/front-end-engineer)

### The Challenge

In this project, I'll build a style guide/design system for a website.

The style guide/design system will include at least a section on colors, fonts, and specific text styles, but it can be extended to as many other areas as I’d like.

### Requirements

1. Style guide should include a labeled section outlining the colors to be used. Each color should have the following:
   - A name
   - A box displaying the color itself
   - The CSS value used to create the color (in hex, rgb(), rbga(), hsl(), or hsla())
   - An optional description of how you intend to use the colors
2. Style guide should include a lableled section of the fonts to be used. Include the following for every font:
   - The font name
   - A series of styles that you intend to use (for example, styles could include: plain, bold and italic, underlined)
   - For each style, include a sentence or series of words to demonstrate the text style (our example site uses the quick brown fox…)
3. Style guide should include a section for specific text styles for page elements. Include at least 3 element styles, and ideally as many as you'd like to use in future sites. For each page element, include:
   - A page element name (for example, "Subheading")
   - All style rules
4. Add any additional styles that you’d like to include to make your style guide/design system look great. This could include positioning, layout, additional colors, box model properties, and more.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3

### What I learned
- I learned how to create a style guide that I will use the basics of in the future to design future sites.

### Continued development
